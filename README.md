Good morning, anyone reading my project.
I've recently read a blog article about CI (Continuous Integration). As I understand, CI is like a methodology. In order to apply this midset, we need IT infrastructure where project team members can join in and share their codes. Github is such a trustful place to do so. So, the purpose of this project is nothing other than getting familiar with concepts like repositories, branches, commits, pull requests and so on.
